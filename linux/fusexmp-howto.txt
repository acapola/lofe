fusexmp notes

small howto on fusexmp as it is provided on fuse website.

build on debian64:
gcc -Wall fusexmp.c -lfuse -o fusexmp -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64

help:
./fusexmp -h

simple use:
1. create mount point:
mkdir ~/tmp/myfs
2. invoke fusexmp
./fusexmp ~/tmp/myfs
This mirror the whole file system inside ~tmp/myfs
The program exit immediatly, a deamon is run in background until the myfs is unmounted
3. unmount
sudo umount ~/tmp/myfs

use with auto unmount:
./fusexmp ~/tmp/myfs -o auto_unmount -f
This time the program keep running until it gets killed (CTRL+C)
When the program exit, myfs is unmounted automatically, but that may take few seconds to take effect.
